refactor so that data is the central focus...
	csv, sql, xml, json, msgpack and many others can be tested through one place...



pre calculate dates at runtime by giving a range OR using a map of ints
	(will increase speed)



add support for blobs in most any language
	(pictures of arbitrary size, etc)
	(maybe a video)
