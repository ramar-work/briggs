Content within the survey will include information requested from each College. This allows for the process to be streamlined into one single survey.

For students that are non-responsive or “still seeking,” they can complete the survey after graduation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>PHASE ONE&nbsp;</p><p>The ___ (position name) will collaborate with each College to collect their current College survey so that they may be inserted into one exclusive FDS.

Content within the survey will include information requested from each College. This allows for the process to be streamlined into one single survey. The survey is created with skip logic for it to be relevant for each student. The survey’s timeline occurs from August to December for the fall term and January to May for the spring term. For students that are non-responsive or “still seeking,” they can complete the survey after graduation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>PHASE ONE&nbsp;</p><p>The ___ (position name) will collaborate with each College to collect their current College survey so that they may be inserted into one exclusive FDS.

Content within the survey will include information requested from each College. This allows for the process to be streamlined into one single survey.

For students that are non-responsive or “still seeking,” they can complete the survey after graduation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>PHASE ONE&nbsp;</p><p>The ___ (position name) will collaborate with each College to collect their current College survey so that they may be inserted into one exclusive FDS.

Content within the survey will include information requested from each College. This allows for the process to be streamlined into one single survey. The survey is created with skip logic for it to be relevant for each student. The survey’s timeline occurs from August to December for the fall term and January to May for the spring term. For students that are non-responsive or “still seeking,” they can complete the survey after graduation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>PHASE ONE&nbsp;</p><p>The ___ (position name) will collaborate with each College to collect their current College survey so that they may be inserted into one exclusive FDS.
